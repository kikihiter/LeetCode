### 1. Two Sum
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].

### 7. Reverse Integer
Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.

Example 1:
Input: 123
Output:  321

Example 2:
Input: -123
Output: -321

Example 3:
Input: 120
Output: 21

Note:
Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only hold integers within the 32-bit signed integer range. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.
