### 041. First Missing Positive
Given an unsorted integer array, find the smallest missing positive integer.</br>

Example 1:</br>
Input: [1,2,0]</br>
Output: 3</br>

Example 2:</br>
Input: [3,4,-1,1]</br>
Output: 2</br>

Example 3:</br>
Input: [7,8,9,11,12]</br>
Output: 1</br>

Note:</br>
Your algorithm should run in O(n) time and uses constant extra space.</br>

### 042. Trapping Rain Water
Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.</br>
The above elevation map is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped. Thanks Marcos for contributing this image!</br>

Example:</br>
Input: [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]</br>
Output: 6

### 045. Jump Game II
Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.</br>
Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.</br>
Your goal is to reach the last index in the minimum number of jumps.</br>

Example:</br>
Input: [2,3,1,1,4]</br>
Output: 2</br>

Explanation:</br>
The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2.</br>
Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.</br>

Note:</br>
You can assume that you can always reach the last index.</br>
